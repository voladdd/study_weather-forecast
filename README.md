## My process

### Set up

#### Start live static server

`npx serve`

### Built with

- HTML & CSS
- Vanilla JS
- API OPEN WEATHER
- 3D Paint

### What I've learned

- How to fetch api requests
- Working with JSON files
- Adding event listeners
- Working with svg files
- How to create simple 3D assets
- Basic animation with javascript

### Continued development

In future i would like to learn modern js component library such as react, in hope that it would make project more scalable and easy to maintain, instead of vanilla js.
